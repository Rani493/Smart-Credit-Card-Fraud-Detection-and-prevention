 ⚙️ How It Works

1. Load and preprocess credit card transaction data.
2. Apply feature selection and data balancing techniques (e.g., SMOTE).
3. Train machine learning models like:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost / LightGBM
   - Isolation Forest (for anomaly detection)
4. Evaluate using metrics like **precision, recall, F1-score, AUC**.
5. Deploy model (optional) to predict incoming transactions in real-time.

 📊 Sample Output

> The model achieves over 95% accuracy on unseen data, with high recall to minimize false negatives (missed frauds).

 🚀 Future Improvements

- Integrate with real-time data streams using Kafka/Spark.
- Build a web dashboard for visualization and alerts.
- Add deep learning techniques for improved accuracy.

📁 Dataset

We use the popular **Kaggle credit card fraud detection dataset**, which contains anonymized transaction features labeled as **fraud** or **not fraud**.
